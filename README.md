# Lemresy's Flinger
A powerful universal flinger for most of games.

# Here's a list what can it has:
- R6, R15 Support
- TargetLock Flinging
- Rounds the player names
  - The thing i meant is for example someone has a very long name, but instead typing it out you can just type the first letters of it and it will locate the user
  - DisplayNames also work


# Commands:
  Prefix = ; (can be changed by editing source)
  
  - ;TargetName / Flings the player (will not 100% time work all time)
  - ;sp / Teleports you to spawnlocation, if spawnlocation isn't present it will teleport you somewhere else
  - ;fixcam / Just in case your camera glitches, you can enter the command and get your camera fixed
 
# Loadstring
  `loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lemresy/LemresyFlinger/main/Main.lua"))()`
# Info

  - Some games might not have collisions, causing the script to not work
  - Theres 1/30 that you might die using it, eventually if you get flung do the ;sp command

  - Created by Lemresy.
